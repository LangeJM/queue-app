# easy Queue

Frontend piece of MERN Stack App to create and manage customer queues. The backend piece can be found [here](https://github.com/LangeJM/queue-app-backend).

This was a team project as part of a coding bootcamp with the [Israel Tech Challenge (ITC)](https://www.itc.tech/). We haven't manage to continue working on it.
